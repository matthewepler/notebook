# Intro to React Ecosystem Video
**Imperative vs. Declarative**
*Imperative* = How you will do something. E.g. looping over an array with a
for-loop doesn't tell us what you're doing, just that you're going to loop.
*Declarative* = What we want to do . E.g. reduce an array to return a specific
result, the equivalent of the for loop but declared in a way that explains
what you want to achieve.

React is mostly declarative. The components are, but the setState() is not.

**Composition**
Making larger components out of smaller components. This is the same as
writing functions that do one thing well, and then you use them to complete a
series of tasks. 

**Explicit Mutations**
The only way to change state is to explicity call this.setState

**React Router**
Mapping component rendering to URLs. 
* foo.com : Main -> Home
* foo.com/playerOne: Main -> PromptContainer
* etc.

**Axios**
Used to make HTTP requests. 

*How does it compare to fetch?* People are split on what to use, but they're
both request libraries, so they accomplish much of the same thing. See latest
documentation on each to determine what you *can't* do with each one.
